## Terminology

The 24 narrow triangles on the board are called *points*. The stones that are moved around during the game are called *checkers*. The board can be split into four boards. Each player has a *home board*. The remaining two boards are called *outer boards*. The points are numbered from 1 to 24 relative to the players view, so that each players home board is comprised of the points from one to six. The vertical space in the middle of the board that separates the home boards from the outer boards is called *bar*.  

## Rules
The rules of the actual Backgammon game have been simplified for the purpose of this project, which is to apply the concept of minimaxing onto a two-player zero-sum game.

### How to win the game
The first player that manages to bear off all his checkers off of his home board wins the game. The other player loses the game. In the actual game, each player gets a number of points based on some criterias which involve an additional doubling cube.

### Start of the game
Here, the human player always starts with the first move. In the real Backgammon game, the player that rolls the bigger number starts with the dice-values, that have just been rolled.

### Moving the checkers
